# Trial of The Spirit

This app was developed to explore some concepts and conventions recommended by the React Native developers' community, such as:

* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)
* [Animated](https://reactnative.dev/docs/animated)
* [Redux](https://redux.js.org) with [duck pattern](https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux)
* [reduxsauce](https://github.com/jkeam/reduxsauce)
* [styled-components](https://styled-components.com)
* [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)
* ...and more!

The main goal now is to arise discussions of best practices and help beginners to understand these implementations.

## How the App works?

It's a mini-game. After the user starts the trial, the app presents ten random quotes from Star Wars movies, authored either by Jedi or Sith. The user indicates if agree or disagree with each quote, and the app calculates which side of the Force the user is more inclined to.

## Why the name?

This is a Legends concept, not Canon, but the Trial of the Spirit is one of the Jedi Trials, where the apprentices had to look deep within their souls, on a quest of self-discovery.
